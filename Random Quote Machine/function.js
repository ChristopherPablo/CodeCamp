var quote = ['']; I'll write all the quotes here and use them instead of a data base.


function randomQuote (){}; to make a function that will take a radom quote to display.


function displayQuotes(){}; make a function to display all the random quotes.


var quote = ["Gota Catch 'em all", "Waaaaaaboooofete"];
